# Final project "GDP and stock market growth"
In this paper we observe how connected or dependent on each other are the GDP and stock market growth. We consider the growth of GDP in USA from 2014 till 2021 year at the same time with stock returns. As stock market indicators we take SP500, AAPL, AXP, IBM, BA. To obtain data we applied Yahoo API. We ivestigate if there are correlations between these variables. As cocnlusion we can state that US gdp mostly correlates with stock market but there're countries that have also high correlatin level to American stock market.
